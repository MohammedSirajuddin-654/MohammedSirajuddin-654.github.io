										<h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I started my career with Bachelors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering where I learned many programming languages related to automation such as PLC programming, C/C++, SCADA, DCS and HMI(Human machine interface) but where I find my real groove on was when I joined Accenture as a Software Developer.
										It is there where I was trained in different programming languages such as Java, Python, Oracle Sql, HTLM, CSS, JavaScript and PL-Sql and was lucky enough to work with amazing clients. <br />It was a harsh winter week in December when I joined Accenture. My health had been affected by the cold, but the adrenaline level of ambition was up in the sky, and the warm and cheerful welcome staff made me feel relaxed.
										In the next few weeks, I learned that I was part of a super-talented team. From there, the journey began under the guidance of my manager (interestingly, my manager was very friendly, which not only made me comfortable in my day-to-day job but also inspired me to grow).<br />
										With baby steps, I completed 1 year in this organization, and not only have I grown as a professional but also as an individual.
										My colleagues know me as a highly creative engineer who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach to solve a given problem<br />

										In the last few years, I have made good friends and worked with inspiring leaders (when they address a team they help you get the spark back and motivate you to do your best). I count myself fortunate enough to have met such brilliant, inspirational, and passionate individuals whom I always have considered committed to excellence.
										The motto of our corporate life is: “Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn,” which means we need to be innovative and we need to transform ourselves to become more agile and open to challenges, we need to fail wisely and network extensively. Life at Accenture is full of rewards and recognition, and lots of employee engagements.
										After 6 months I joined Amazon as a process specialist .Working at Amazon was about making work fun, having a good work-life balance, as well as good synergy between work culture and productivity.
